# Simsimi discord bot

An ass bot that roast you lol

Now reply your message in DM!

Thank @OrdinaryEnder for the Idea and code

Made in Pythonâ„¢

## Run the bot
### Install requirements and run on your system

1. Install Python 3, if you don't know how to then just google it

But on Debian/Ubuntu/Termux you can install Python by running
```
sudo apt install -y python
```
remove `sudo` if you are using root account or Termux

2. Install requirements by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Edit `.env` by any text editor

`TOKEN` is your bot's token, if you don't have one then go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create one

`CHANNEL` is the channel's ID you want the bot to reply to message send there

`LANGUAGE` is for language code, `vn` if you refer the bot to use Vietnamese or `en` if you want the bot to use English

4. Then execute `main.py` by running
```
python main.py
```

### Run on Replit

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Opstober/simsimi-discord-bot)](https://replit.com/@Opstober/simsimi-discord-bot)

Clone this repo then when they ask you for run command just type in `python main.py` then just go to Commands > Secret Environment then configure `TOKEN`, `CHANNEL` and `LANGUAGE` then click the run button
